        <p><h3>The Parallels are Uncanny</h3></p>
        <p>From my perspective as a <strong>South Asian</strong>, <strong>non-white</strong>, <strong>female designer</strong>,
            Buzon’s article offers a refreshing counterpoint to the eurocentric
            frameworks that dominate design today.
            In particular, I find his description of <em>design thinking</em>
            as a form of <em>colonialism</em> quite fascinating:
            <blockquote

                This form of colonialism however was never unique to design nor the 
                tech giants which have co-opted it. We have seen in modern history 
                how the extraction of wealth takes many forms: the pillaging of 
                indigenous lands, cultural appropriation, and wage theft which its victims 
                today continue to be under Stockholm syndrome induced by their masters.

            Tracing the roots of this now-popular design ideology,
            he exposes the vernacular of its founders, highlighting
            it as <strong>otherising</strong> and <strong>racist</strong>. 
            A personal favorite example is that of graphic designer Vignelli,
            who warned against creating <em>visual pollution</em> at the
            hands of using 'too many typefaces': 
             <blockquote 
            cite="https://dabuzon.medium.com/design-thinking-is-a-rebrand-for-white-supremacy-b3d31aa55831">
                Consider sentiments many Modernists were vocal about. The Italian graphic designer
                Massimo Vignelli often is cited as defending the practice of using only four typefaces 
                and disparaging “visual pollution.” Whether Vignelli realized his eugenics-adjacent 
                language or not, his belief in the designer's fight “against the ugliness” further 
                cemented Modernist practice of erasure and consolidation.
             </blockquote>

            <p><h3>Manifestations in Design Language Itself</h3></p>
            <p>
            It is interesting to see how euro-centric language seeps its way into visual
            forms as well (in this case, the neglect of indigenous scripts). <br />
            <em>[see: third header]</em><br />

            <br />Another instance involves the use of the word <em>solving</em>,
            i.e. seeing the outside world as a 'problem' to be ‘fixed’ and ‘made better’. 
            Other manifestations of visual colonialism arise in the form 
            itself: just as ‘whiteness’ is deemed to be <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>progressive</strong>, 
            and <strong>efficient</strong>, so too are ‘white’ typefaces (Helvetica, Futura, Arial and so on).</p>
